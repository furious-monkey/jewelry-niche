I try to made a jewelry website. I will be using React for the front-end and Node Express for the back-end. The styling part will be done using CSS and React Bootstrap while the functionality will be added using JSX. I plan on making it as user-friendly as possible.

The customer can sign in/sign up with Google and email password. Customers can purchase easily through the site. And there are other features such as customers can check their Orders, Get Feedback and many more. And Admin can Create, Manage Product, Manage orders and make another user as an admin. The design is pretty simple and the user won’t find it difficult to understand, use and navigate.

📘 Login/Register System With Google <br/>
📘 Login/Register System With Email and Password <br/>

📘 Manage, Create Product <br/>
